	abstract = {Background
Accurate risk stratification of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for optimizing resource allocation, delivering targeted interventions, and maximizing patient survival probability. Machine learning (ML) techniques are attracting increased interest for the development of prediction models as they excel in the analysis of complex signals in data-rich environments such as critical care.
Methods
We retrieved data on patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) between March and October 2020 from the RIsk Stratification in COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (RISC-19-ICU) registry. We applied the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to the data to predict as a binary outcome the increase or decrease in patients’ Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 5 after ICU admission. The model was iteratively cross-validated in different subsets of the study cohort.
Results
The final study population consisted of 675 patients. The XGBoost model correctly predicted a decrease in SOFA score in 320/385 (83\%) critically ill COVID-19 patients, and an increase in the score in 210/290 (72\%) patients. The area under the mean receiver operating characteristic curve for XGBoost was significantly higher than that for the logistic regression model (0.86 vs. 0.69, P {\textless} 0.01 [paired t-test with 95\% confidence interval]).
Conclusions
The XGBoost model predicted the change in SOFA score in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU and can guide clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) aimed at optimizing available resources.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities to improve private and public life. Discovering patterns and structures in large troves of data in an automated manner is a core component of data science, and currently drives applications in diverse areas such as computational biology, law and finance. However, such a highly positive impact is coupled with a significant challenge: how do we understand the decisions suggested by these systems in order that we can trust them? In this report, we focus specifically on data-driven methods—machine learning (ML) and pattern recognition models in particular—so as to survey and distill the results and observations from the literature. The purpose of this report can be especially appreciated by noting that ML models are increasingly deployed in a wide range of businesses. However, with the increasing prevalence and complexity of methods, business stakeholders in the very least have a growing number of concerns about the drawbacks of models, data-specific biases, and so on. Analogously, data science practitioners are often not aware about approaches emerging from the academic literature or may struggle to appreciate the differences between different methods, so end up using industry standards such as SHAP. Here, we have undertaken a survey to help industry practitioners (but also data scientists more broadly) understand the field of explainable machine learning better and apply the right tools. Our latter sections build a narrative around a putative data scientist, and discuss how she might go about explaining her models by asking the right questions. From an organization viewpoint, after motivating the area broadly, we discuss the main developments, including the principles that allow us to study transparent models vs. opaque models, as well as model-specific or model-agnostic post-hoc explainability approaches. We also briefly reflect on deep learning models, and conclude with a discussion about future research directions.},

Unexpected ICU readmission is associated with longer length of stay and increased mortality. To prevent ICU readmission and death after ICU discharge, our team of intensivists and data scientists aimed to use AmsterdamUMCdb to develop an explainable machine learning–based real-time bedside decision support tool.

Derivation Cohort:
Data from patients admitted to a mixed surgical-medical academic medical center ICU from 2004 to 2016.

Validation Cohort:
Data from 2016 to 2019 from the same center.

Prediction Model:
Patient characteristics, clinical observations, physiologic measurements, laboratory studies, and treatment data were considered as model features. Different supervised learning algorithms were trained to predict ICU readmission and/or death, both within 7 days from ICU discharge, using 10-fold cross-validation. Feature importance was determined using SHapley Additive exPlanations, and readmission probability-time curves were constructed to identify subgroups. Explainability was established by presenting individualized risk trends and feature importance.

Results:
Our final derivation dataset included 14,105 admissions. The combined readmission/mortality rate within 7 days of ICU discharge was 5.3\%. Using Gradient Boosting, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.75–0.81) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.19 on the validation cohort (n = 3,929). The most predictive features included common physiologic parameters but also less apparent variables like nutritional support. At a 6\% risk threshold, the model showed a sensitivity (recall) of 0.72, specificity of 0.70, and a positive predictive value (precision) of 0.15. Impact analysis using probability-time curves and the 6\% risk threshold identified specific patient groups at risk and the potential of a change in discharge management to reduce relative risk by 14\%.

Conclusions:
We developed an explainable machine learning model that may aid in identifying patients at high risk for readmission and mortality after ICU discharge using the first freely available European critical care database, AmsterdamUMCdb. Impact analysis showed that a relative risk reduction of 14\% could be achievable, which might have significant impact on patients and society.

As a consequence, numerous papers on the topic exist. The goal of this paper is to provide the first structured literature review on how OR/MS may support ICU management. We start our review by illustrating the important role the ICU plays in the hospital patient flow. Then we focus on the ICU management problem (single department management problem) and classify the literature from multiple angles, including decision horizons, problem settings, and modeling and solution techniques.

These efforts require predictions of Length of Stay (LOS) values; however, it is unclear how accurate these predictions need to be. This study investigates the relationship between the accuracy level of LOS predictions and operational performance indicators. A discrete event simulation model is developed to model the ICU patient flows. A linear function of actual and simulated LOS values is used to measure the accuracy level of the predictions. Multiple configurations of patient mix and patient waiting threshold were included in the simulation scenarios. Performance indicators are the average waiting time of patients for an ICU bed and overall admission ratios. Further statistical tests were carried out to evaluate the significance of the results. Results suggest that inaccurate LOS predictions overestimated both the average waiting time of patients for an ICU bed and overall admission rates which can have several quality and performance implications for hospitals. The gaps increased when more elective patients were included in the patient mix. Moreover, higher waiting thresholds (i.e., the maximum amount of time a patient will wait for an ICU bed) yielded higher values in both performance indicators.},

We aimed to define characteristics and outcomes of short-stay ICU patients whose need for ICU level-of-care is ≤24 h compared to nonshort-stay patients.
METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the medical ICU at an academic tertiary care center in 2019. Fisher's exact test or Chi-square for descriptive categorical variables, t-test for continuous variables, and Mann-Whitney two-sample test for length of stay (LOS) outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 819 patients, 206 (25.2\%) were short-stay compared to 613 (74.8\%) nonshort-stay. The severity of illness as measured by the Mortality Probability Model-III was significantly lower among short-stay compared to nonshort-stay patients (P = 0.0001). Most short-stay patients were admitted for hemodynamic monitoring not requiring vasoactive medications (77, 37.4\%). Thirty-six (17.5\%) of the short-stay cohort met Society of Critical Care Medicine's guidelines for ICU admission. Nonfull-ICU LOS, or time spent waiting for transfer out to a non-ICU bed, was similar between the two groups. Hospital mortality was lower among short-stay patients compared to nonshort-stay patients (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite their lower illness severity and fewer ICU-level care needs, short-stay patients spend an equally substantial amount of time occupying an ICU bed while waiting for a floor bed as nonshort-stay patients. Further investigation into the factors influencing ICU triage of these subacute patients and contributors to system inefficiencies prohibiting their timely transfer may improve ICU resource allocation, hospital throughput, and patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: High demand for intensive care unit (ICU) services and limited bed availability have prompted hospitals to address capacity planning challenges. Simulation modeling can examine ICU bed assignment policies, accounting for patient acuity, to reduce ICU admission delays.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a framework for data-driven modeling of ICU patient flow, identify key measurable outcomes, and present illustrative analysis demonstrating the impact of various bed allocation scenarios on outcomes.
METHODS: A description of key inputs for constructing a queuing model was outlined, and an illustrative simulation model was developed to reflect current triage protocol within the medical ICU and step-down unit (SDU) at a single tertiary-care hospital. Patient acuity, arrival rate, and unit length of stay, consisting of a "service time" and "time to transfer," were estimated from 12 months of retrospective data (n = 2,710 adult patients) for 36 ICU and 15 SDU staffed beds. Patient priority was based on acuity and whether the patient originated in the emergency department. The model simulated the following hypothetical scenarios: (1) varied ICU/SDU sizes, (2) reserved ICU beds as a triage strategy, (3) lower targets for time to transfer out of the ICU, and (4) ICU expansion by up to four beds. Outcomes included ICU admission wait times and unit occupancy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: With current bed allocation, simulated wait time averaged 1.13 (SD, 1.39) hours. Reallocating all SDU beds as ICU decreased overall wait times by 7.2\% to 1.06 (SD, 1.39) hours and increased bed occupancy from 80 to 84\%. Reserving the last available bed for acute patients reduced wait times for acute patients from 0.84 (SD, 1.12) to 0.31 (SD, 0.30) hours, but tripled subacute patients' wait times from 1.39 (SD, 1.81) to 4.27 (SD, 5.44) hours. Setting transfer times to wards for all ICU/SDU patients to 1 hour decreased wait times for incoming ICU patients, comparable to building one to two additional ICU beds.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital queuing and simulation modeling with empiric data inputs can evaluate how changes in ICU bed assignment could impact unit occupancy levels and patient wait times. Trade-offs associated with dedicating resources for acute patients versus expanding capacity for all patients can be examined.},

RESULTS: The study found that functional ICU capacity, ie, the number of occupied ICU beds at which operative procedures were canceled if they were known to require an ICU stay, was the main determinant of the wait, the number performed, and the number of cancellations of operative procedures known to require an ICU stay. The study also found that actual and functional ICU capacity jointly explained ICU utilization and the mean number of patients that should have been in the ICU that were parked elsewhere.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the necessity of considering actual and functional ICU capacity when analyzing surgical ICU bed requirements, and suggested the need for additional research on synchronizing demand with supply. The study also reinforced the authors' sense that simulation facilitates the evaluation of trade-offs between surgical management alternatives proposed by experts and the identification of unexpected drawbacks or opportunities of those proposals.},

Hospitals currently lack a methodology to selectively admit patients to these units in a way that patient health risk metrics can be incorporated while considering the congestion that will occur. The hospital is modeled as a complex loss queueing network with a stochastic model of how long risk-stratified patients spend time in particular units and how they transition between units. A Mixed Integer Programming model approximates an optimal admission control policy for the network of units. While enforcing low levels of patient blocking, we optimize a monotonic dual-threshold admission policy. A hospital network including Intermediate Care Units (IMCs) and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) was considered for validation. The optimized model indicated a reduction in the risk levels required for admission, and weekly average admissions to ICUs and IMCs increased by 37\% and 12\%, respectively, with minimal blocking. Our methodology captures utilization and accessibility in a network model of care pathways while supporting the personalized allocation of scarce care resources to the neediest patients. The interesting benefits of admission thresholds that vary by day of week are studied.},

Studies showed the necessity of using simulation approach when encountering complex real-world problems to plan the optimal use of resources and improve the quality of services. So, the aim of the present study is to estimate average length of stay (LOS), BOR, bed blocking probability (BBP), and throughput of patients in a cardiac surgery department (CSD) using simulation models. We studied the behavior of a CSD as a complex queueing system at the Farshchian Hospital. In the queueing model, customers were patients and servers were beds in intensive care unit (ICU) and post-operative ward (POW). A computer program based on the Monte Carlo simulation, using Python software, was developed to evaluate the behavior of the system under different number of beds in ICU and POW. The queueing simulation study showed that, for a fixed number of beds in ICU, BOR in POW decreases as the number of beds in POW increases and LOS in ICU increases as the number of beds in POW decreases. Also, based on the available data, the throughput of patients in the CSD during 800 days was 1999 patients. Whereas, the simulation results showed that, 2839 patients can be operated in the same period. The results of the simulation study clearly demonstrated the behavior of the CSD; so, it must be mentioned, hospital administrators should design an efficient plan to increase BOR and throughput of patients in the future.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Intensive care is generally regarded as expensive, and as a result beds are limited. This has raised serious questions about rationing when there are insufficient beds for all those referred. However, the evidence for the cost effectiveness of intensive care is weak and the work that does exist usually assumes that those who are not admitted do not survive, which is not always the case. Randomised studies of the effectiveness of intensive care are difficult to justify on ethical grounds; therefore, this observational study examined the cost effectiveness of ICU admission by comparing patients who were accepted into ICU after ICU triage to those who were not accepted, while attempting to adjust such comparison for confounding factors.
Methods: This multi-centre observational cohort study involved 11 hospitals in 7 EU countries and was designed to assess the cost effectiveness of admission to intensive care after ICU triage. A total of 7,659 consecutive patients referred to the intensive care unit (ICU) were divided into those accepted for admission and those not accepted. The two groups were compared in terms of cost and mortality using multilevel regression models to account for differences across centres, and after adjusting for age, Karnofsky score and indication for ICU admission. The analyses were also stratified by categories of Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II predicted mortality ({\textless} 5\%, 5\% to 40\% and {\textgreater}40\%). Cost effectiveness was evaluated as cost per life saved and cost per life-year saved.
Results: Admission to ICU produced a relative reduction in mortality risk, expressed as odds ratio, of 0.70 (0.52 to 0.94) at 28 days. When stratified by predicted mortality, the odds ratio was 1.49 (0.79 to 2.81), 0.7 (0.51 to 0.97) and 0.55 (0.37 to 0.83) for {\textless}5\%, 5\% to 40\% and {\textgreater}40\% predicted mortality, respectively. Average cost per life saved for all patients was \$103,771 (€82,358) and cost per life-year saved was \$7,065 (€5,607). These figures decreased substantially for patients with predicted mortality higher than 40\%, \$60,046 (€47,656) and \$4,088 (€3,244), respectively. Results were very similar when considering three-month mortality. Sensitivity analyses performed to assess the robustness of the results provided findings similar to the main analyses.
Conclusions: Not only does ICU appear to produce an improvement in survival, but the cost per life saved falls for patients with greater severity of illness. This suggests that intensive care is similarly cost effective to other therapies that are generally regarded as essential.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the daily cost of intensive care unit (ICU) stays via micro-costing.
METHODS: A multicentre, prospective, observational, cost analysis study was carried out among 21 out of 23 French ICUs randomly selected from French National Hospitals. Each ICU randomly enrolled 5 admitted adult patients with a simplified acute physiology II score ≥ 15 and with at least one major intensive care medical procedure. All health-care human resources used by each patient over a 24-hour period were recorded, as well as all medications, laboratory analyses, investigations, tests, consumables and administrative expenses. All resource costs were estimated from the hospital's perspective (reference year 2009) based on unitary cost data.
RESULTS: One hundred and four patients were included (mean age: 62.3 ± 14.9 years, mean SAPS II: 51.5 ± 16.1, mean SOFA on the study day: 6.9 ± 4.3). Over 24 hours, 29 to 186 interventions per patient were performed by different caregivers, leading to a mean total time spent for patient care of 13:32 ± 05:00 h. The total daily cost per patient was € 1425 ± € 520 (95\% CI = € 1323 to € 1526). ICU human resources represented 43\% of total daily cost. Patient-dependent expenses (€ 842 ± € 521) represented 59\% of the total daily cost. The total daily cost was correlated with the daily SOFA score (r = 0.271, P = 0.006) and the bedside-time given by caregivers (r = 0.716, P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The average cost of one day of ICU care in French National Hospitals is strongly correlated with the duration of bedside-care carried out by human resources.},

	abstract = {Objective: We systematically reviewed models to predict adult ICU
length of stay.
Data Sources: We searched the Ovid EMBASE and MEDLINE
databases for studies on the development or validation of ICU
length of stay prediction models.
Study Selection: We identified 11 studies describing the development
of 31 prediction models and three describing external validation
of one of these models.
Data Extraction: Clinicians use ICU length of stay predictions for
planning ICU capacity, identifying unexpectedly long ICU length
of stay, and benchmarking ICUs. We required the model variables
to have been published and for the models to be free of organizational
characteristics and to produce accurate predictions, as
assessed by R2 across patients for planning and identifying unexpectedly
long ICU length of stay and across ICUs for benchmarking,
with low calibration bias. We assessed the reporting quality
using the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for
Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies.
Data Synthesis: The number of admissions ranged from 253
to 178,503. Median ICU length of stay was between 2 and
6.9 days. Two studies had not published model variables and three
included organizational characteristics. None of the models produced
predictions with low bias. The R2 was 0.05–0.28 across patients and
0.01–0.64 across ICUs. The reporting scores ranged from 49 of 78
to 60 of 78 and the methodologic scores from 12 of 22 to 16 of 22.
Conclusion: No models completely satisfy our requirements for
planning, identifying unexpectedly long ICU length of stay, or for
benchmarking purposes. Physicians using these models to predict
ICU length of stay should interpret them with reservation.},

This paper defines the theoretical bounds on optimal bed demand prediction accuracy and develops a flexible statistical model to approximate the probability mass function of future bed demand. A case study validates the model using blinded data from a mid-sized Massachusetts community hospital. This approach expands upon similar work by forecasting multiple days in advance instead of a single day, providing a probability mass function of demand instead of a point estimate, using the exact surgery schedule instead of assuming a cyclic schedule, and using patient-level duration-varying length-of-stay distributions instead of assuming patient homogeneity and exponential length of stay distributions. The primary results of this work are an accurate and lengthy forecast, which provides managers better information and more time to optimize short-term staffing adaptations to stochastic bed demand, and a derivation of the minimum mean absolute error of an ideal forecast.},

	abstract = {Background
              Bed occupancy in the ICU is a major constraint to in-patient care during COVID-19 pandemic. Diagnoses of acute respiratory infection (ARI) by general practitioners have not previously been investigated as an early warning indicator of ICU occupancy.
            
            
              Methods
              A population-based central health care system registry in the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain, was used to analyze all diagnoses of ARI related to COVID-19 established by general practitioners and the number of occupied ICU beds in all hospitals from Catalonia between March 26, 2020 and January 20, 2021. The primary outcome was the cross-correlation between the series of COVID-19-related ARI cases and ICU bed occupancy taking into account the effect of bank holidays and weekends. Recalculations were later implemented until March 27, 2022.
            
            
              Findings
              Weekly average incidence of ARI diagnoses increased from 252.7 per 100,000 in August, 2020 to 496.5 in October, 2020 (294.2 in November, 2020), while the average number of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19-infected patients rose from 1.7 per 100,000 to 3.5 in the same period (6.9 in November, 2020). The incidence of ARI detected in the primary care setting anticipated hospital occupancy of ICUs, with a maximum correlation of 17.3 days in advance (95\% confidence interval 15.9 to 18.9).
            
            
              Interpretation
              COVID-19-related ARI cases may be a novel warning sign of ICU occupancy with a delay of over two weeks, a latency window period for establishing restrictions on social contacts and mobility to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19. Monitoring ARI cases would enable immediate adoption of measures to prevent ICU saturation in future waves.},

	abstract = {Background: Detailed data on intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy in Japan are lacking. Using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan, we aimed to assess ICU bed occupancy to guide critical care utilization planning.
Methods: We identiﬁed all ICU patients admitted from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2018 to ICU-equipped hospitals participating in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database. We assessed the trends in daily occupancy by counting the total number of occupied ICU beds on a given day divided by the total number of licensed ICU beds in the participating hospitals. We also assessed ICU occupancy for patients with mechanical ventilation, patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and patients without life-supportive therapies.
Results: Over the 4 study years, 1,379,618 ICU patients were admitted to 495 hospitals equipped with 5,341 ICU beds, accounting for 75\% of all ICU beds in Japan. Mean ICU occupancy on any given day was 60\%, with a range of 45.0\% to 72.5\%. Mean ICU occupancy did not change over the 4 years. Mean ICU occupancy was about 9\% higher on weekdays than on weekends and about 5\% higher in the coldest season than in the warmest season. For patients with mechanical ventilation, patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and patients without life-supportive therapies, mean ICU occupancy was 24\%, 0.5\%, and 30\%, respectively.
Conclusion: Only one-fourth of ICU beds were occupied by mechanically ventilated patients, suggesting that the critical care system in Japan has substantial surge capacity under normal temporal variation to care for critically ill patients.},

Objective: We describe the development of a dynamic simulation framework to support agile resource planning during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Materials and Methods: The study data were derived from the Singapore General Hospital and public domain sources over the period from 1 January 2020 till 31 May 2020 covering the period when the initial outbreak and surge of COVID-19 cases in Singapore happened. The simulation models and its variants take into consideration the dynamic evolution of the pandemic and the rapidly evolving policies and processes in Singapore.
Results: The models were calibrated against historical data for the Singapore COVID-19 situation. Several variants of the resource planning model were rapidly developed to adapt to the fast-changing COVID-19 situation in Singapore.
Conclusion: The agility in adaptable models and robust collaborative management structure enabled the quick deployment of human and capital resources to sustain the high level of health services delivery during the COVID-19 surge.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Bed occupancy rate (BOR) is important for healthcare policymakers. Studies showed the necessity of using simulation approach when encountering complex real-world problems to plan the optimal use of resources and improve the quality of services. So, the aim of the present study is to estimate average length of stay (LOS), BOR, bed blocking probability (BBP), and throughput of patients in a cardiac surgery department (CSD) using simulation models. We studied the behavior of a CSD as a complex queueing system at the Farshchian Hospital. In the queueing model, customers were patients and servers were beds in intensive care unit (ICU) and post-operative ward (POW). A computer program based on the Monte Carlo simulation, using Python software, was developed to evaluate the behavior of the system under different number of beds in ICU and POW. The queueing simulation study showed that, for a fixed number of beds in ICU, BOR in POW decreases as the number of beds in POW increases and LOS in ICU increases as the number of beds in POW decreases. Also, based on the available data, the throughput of patients in the CSD during 800 days was 1999 patients. Whereas, the simulation results showed that, 2839 patients can be operated in the same period. The results of the simulation study clearly demonstrated the behavior of the CSD; so, it must be mentioned, hospital administrators should design an efficient plan to increase BOR and throughput of patients in the future.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a discrete event simulation model to support decision-making for the short-term planning of hospital resource needs, especially Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, to cope with outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Given its purpose as a short-term forecasting tool, the simulation model requires an accurate representation of the current system state and high ﬁdelity in mimicking the system dynamics from that state. The two main components of the simulation model are the stochastic modeling of patient admission and patient ﬂow processes. The patient arrival process is modelled using a Gompertz growth model, which enables the representation of the exponential growth caused by the initial spread of the virus, followed by a period of maximum arrival rate and then a decreasing phase until the wave subsides. We conducted an empirical study concluding that the Gompertz model provides a better ﬁt to pandemic-related data (positive cases and hospitalization numbers) and has superior prediction capacity than other sigmoid models based on Richards, Logistic, and Stannard functions. Patient ﬂow modelling considers different pathways and dynamic length of stay estimation in several healthcare stages using patient-level data. We report on the application of the simulation model in two Autonomous Regions of Spain (Navarre and La Rioja) during the two COVID-19 waves experienced in 2020. The simulation model was employed on a daily basis to inform the regional logistic health care planning team, who programmed the ward and ICU beds based on the resulting predictions.},

	abstract = {The intensive care unit (ICU) is one of the most crucial and expensive resources in a health care system. While high fixed costs usually lead to tight capacities, shortages have severe consequences. Thus, various challenging issues exist: When should an ICU admit or reject arriving patients in general? Should ICUs always be able to admit critical patients or rather focus on high utilization? On an operational level, both admission control of arriving patients and demand-driven early discharge of currently residing patients are decision variables and should be considered simultaneously. This paper discusses the trade-off between medical and monetary goals when managing intensive care units by modeling the problem as a Markov decision process. Intuitive, myopic rule mimicking decision-making in practice is applied as a benchmark. In a numerical study based on real-world data, we demonstrate that the medical results deteriorate dramatically when focusing on monetary goals only, and vice versa. Using our model, we illustrate the trade-off along an efficiency frontier that accounts for all combinations of medical and monetary goals. Coming from a solution that optimizes monetary costs, a significant reduction of expected mortality can be achieved at little additional monetary cost.},
