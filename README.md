The ICU Bed Prediction Model Repository is a comprehensive collection of resources and code for a predictive model that aims to forecast the availability of ICU beds in a hospital's intensive care unit. The repository provides the necessary tools and materials for developing, training, evaluating, and deploying the ICU bed prediction model.

Features:

Data Processing Scripts: Contains scripts to preprocess and clean the ICU bed data, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

Model Training Code: Includes code for training the prediction model using machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides code and scripts to evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Deployment: Offers guidelines and examples for deploying the trained model in a production environment, including considerations for scalability, real-time predictions, and integration with existing systems.

Documentation: Contains detailed documentation explaining the data, methodology, and implementation details of the ICU bed prediction model. It includes instructions on how to use the repository and reproduce the results.

Sample Data: Includes a sample dataset of ICU bed occupancy with relevant features to facilitate model development and testing.

Examples: Provides code examples and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating step-by-step implementation of the ICU bed prediction model using popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Requirements: Lists the necessary dependencies and versions required to run the code successfully.

License: Specifies the licensing information for the repository, ensuring proper usage and attribution.
